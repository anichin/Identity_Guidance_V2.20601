If you add new expenses they are not persisted. The application does not use a database.
If you want to add some expenses associated with the new user you have to add this to ExpenseRepository.cs

If you get an exception like this:

System.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicException occurred
  HResult=0x80090016
  Message=Keyset does not exist
  
You need to relax the access to the certificates.

I gave full access to "Everyone" for these certificates under Personal\Certificates
